# First-Order Logic Library in Python

I am interested in building a first-order logic library in Python. So far I have been working on the library from the perspective of Model Theory, with the aim to build functions that can check for example whether a given finite structure is a model of a given finite theory. My ultimate goal is to build functions that can handle more symbolic tasks as well, such as transforming sentences into canonical forms, using inference rules to deduce new information, or determining whether a given statement can be proven from certain assumptions.
